# biotrans_multiprompt
BioTransformer Batch Mode for Multiple Models

Python script as an extension to predict biotransformation for multiple chemicals and multiple transformation models using BioTransformer3.0.
Please read about BioTransformer3.0 here: https://biotransformer.ca/ 
                                          https://github.com/Wishartlab-openscience/Biotransformer

The script is required to run from inside the cloned BioTransformer repository and needs an input file containing the chemicals in SMILES format (one chemical in each line without further signs).
